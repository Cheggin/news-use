## News: By You and For You. 

We thought that a great use of Browser Use would be to aggregate specific news articles that we were specifically interested in. Why use one source when Browser Use could scrape multiple? And why not create curated articles that are specifically tuned to your interests? 

## Technical Implementation: 

- **Frontend:** Vite (React + Typescript), Tailwind v4
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Browser Use
- **Database:** Convex
